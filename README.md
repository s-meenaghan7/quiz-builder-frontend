# React Quiz Builder

This ReactJS application allows the user to create a multiple-choice quiz or test.

## Summary

After successfully creating a simple React quiz app, I was inspired to interate on that apps design. This application allows the user to actually create the quiz itself. Each quiz can have as many questions as the user desires, and each question can have as many answers as desired, with a minimum of 2 answers per question.
